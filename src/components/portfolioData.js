Each of the nine squares is a 'Square' component that shows a different shape based on the game's state, which I thought was quite an intuative way of doing things. The part that required the most thinking was the game ai. I solved this by splitting up the grid into 8 rows of three (3 horizontal, 3 vertical and 2 diagonal), and checking them individually to see if there is a way to win, a way to stop the player winning, otherwise just try and build up two pieces on one row. It's quite simple but it makes it almost impossible to beat. From idea to fully styled end product in less than three days."],
