I still had to learn lots of new things but I had a confidence in my workflow. It made me happy that my skills could make a small 'wish' of mine come true.","It is a customisable set of timers that can be used for yoga, exercise or otherwise. 4 minutes doing this, 3 minutes doing that etc. The sound played between each interval is customisable, the name of the activity can be spoken with generated speech, and each interval can be furth split up into periods of activity and rest. Routines can be saved to local storage and loaded and again and when it's playing then there is a self made pie timer on screen. It is all quite proffesional feeling and smooth and it does everything it needs to do in an intuitive way. It was created using react, redux, html, scss and react-router. I like it."],

I planned it out with diagrams of how it would all connect, then got going, but after lots of pushing I had to give up. As luck would have it I moved on to learning redux and this 'global state' fixed all the issues I was stuck on and let me complete it to my high standards. ", "It has quite extensive options about placing and positioning barriers, as well as number and movement of the sperm components. It runs well and the learning algorithms actually work! It's a bit rude but I was making it interesting for myself by making a literal version of a 'genetic' algorithm."],

        text: ["I made this to test my understanding of react upon first learning it. Each of the nine squares is a 'Square' component that shows a different shape based on the game's state, which I thought was quite an intuitive way of doing things. The part that required the most thinking was the game ai. I solved this by splitting up the grid into 8 rows of three (3 horizontal, 3 vertical and 2 diagonal), and checking them individually to see if there is a way to win, a way to stop the player winning, otherwise just try and build up two pieces on one row. It's quite simple but it makes it almost impossible to beat. From idea to fully styled end product in less than three days."],
